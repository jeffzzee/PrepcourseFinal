  <h3>About me</h3><!--lesser title type than h1 and h2 have used -->
    <p>I have many years of graphic design and illustration experience. I have made t-shirts, logos, and websites for numerous companies and organizations. I have honed my illustration skill in the realm of creating the imaginary. I cofounded pitchblank comics a small company which encourages and facilitates creativity through a line of do-it-yourself workbooks. I spend a lot of my time playing music especially guitar and voice.</p>
    
    <p>While pursuing my creative outlets I recognized just how pivotal and necessary an effective web presence can be for sharing the work of any endeavor. The realization of it's utility steered me toward learning how to do it. In 2020 I set out to learn all I could. I enrolled in Thinkful's engineering immersion program and have learned a whole lot in the preliminary course. I am more excited than ever to continue expanding my knowledge and ability to utilize programming. I find that coding has an inherent leverage and depth of opportunity which is very empowering. A deep understanding of coding really seems to make anything possible. I love to take an idea and use code to make its function as efficient as possible while maintaining the primary intentions of the project.</p>
    
    <p>I am eager to work with clients and collaborators on front and back-end website development. I want to work together to solidify your vision of web presence. Whether it’s a new project, built from the ground up, or bringing a preexisting site up to date, I can help you and your team realize your goals.</p>
    <p>Let’s work together to make your dream a reality!</p>
